          Due to the existing regulatory environment, we cannot ensure that all
          of your private communications and other personally identifiable
          information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in
          this Privacy Policy. By way of example (without limiting and
          foregoing), we may be forced to disclose information to the
          government, law enforcement agencies or third parties. Under certain
          circumstances, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access
          transmissions or private communications, or members may abuse or
          misuse your information that they collect from our Website/App.
          Therefore, although we use industry standard practices to protect your
          privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your
          personally identifiable information or private communications would
          always remain private.
          <br />
          However, we have all the rights to display details collected from You.
          We may use the collected information and display the same on our
          Website/App. Further we may sell/give for free such information to
          other Website/Apps/companies/agencies. The following describes some of
          the ways that your personally identifiable information may be
          disclosed:
          <br />
          <b>External Service Providers: </b>There may be a number of services
          offered by external service providers that help you use our
          Website/Apps. If you choose to use these optional services, and in the
          course of doing so, disclose information to the external service
          providers, and/or grant them permission to collect information about
          you, then their use of your information is governed by their private
          policy.
          <br />
          <b>Other Corporate Entities: </b>We share much of our data, including
          personally identifiable information about you, with our parent and/or
          subsidiaries that are committed to serving your online needs and
          related services, throughout the world. Such data will be shared for
          the sole purpose of enhancing your browsing experience and providing
          our services to you.
          <br />
          Further We may share any data obtained/collected with our advertising
          and analytics partners. We may divulge your personal information i.e.
          name, email id, phone number to other companies, agencies or
          corporations for financial/non-financial benefits. To the extent that
          these entities have access to your information, they will treat it at
          least as protectively as they treat information they obtain from their
          other members. It is possible that We and/or its subsidiaries, or any
          combination of such, could merge with or be acquired by another
          business entity. Should such a combination occur, you should expect
          that we would share some or all of your information in order to
          continue to provide the service. You may or may not receive notice of
          such event.
          <br />
          <b>Law and Order:</b> We cooperate with law enforcement inquiries, as
          well as other third parties to enforce laws, such as: intellectual
          property rights, fraud and other rights. We can (and you authorize us
          to) disclose any information about you to law enforcement and other
          government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary
          or appropriate, in connection with an investigation of fraud,
          intellectual property infringements, or other activity that is illegal
          or may expose us or you to legal liability.

          Following registration, you can review and change all the information
          you sub- mitted each time except your email id. If you change any
          information we may keep track of your old information. You can change
          your registration information such as: name, address, city, state, zip
          code, country, phone number and profile.
          <br />
          We will retain in our files information you have requested to remove
          for certain circumstances, such as to resolve disputes, troubleshoot
          problems and enforce our terms and conditions. Further, such prior
          information is never completely removed from our databases due to
          technical and legal constraints, including stored ‘back up’ systems.
          Therefore, you should not expect that all of your personally
          identifiable information will be completely removed from our databases
          in response to your requests.

          When you sign up to become a Member, you will also be asked to choose
          a password. You are entirely responsible for maintaining the
          confidentiality of your password. It is important that you protect it
          against unauthorized access of your account and information by
          choosing your password carefully, and keeping your password and
          computer secure by signing out after using our services.

          You agree not to use the account, username, email address or password
          of an- other Member at any time or to disclose your password to any
          third party. If you choose to share this information with third
          parties to provide you additional services, you are responsible for
          all actions taken with your login information and password and
          therefore should review each third party’s privacy policy. You are
          responsible for all actions taken with your login information and
          password, including fees. If you lose control of your password, you
          may lose substantial control over your personally identifiable
          information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on
          your behalf. Therefore, if your password has been compromised for any
          reason, you should immediately change your password. You agree to
          notify us immediately if you suspect any consistent unauthorized use
          of your account or access to your password even after changing it.

          We treat data as an asset that must be protected against loss and
          unauthorized access. We employ many different security techniques to
          protect such data from unauthorized access by members inside and
          outside the Firm. We do not recommend transfer of sensitive
          information (such as credit card number) and bank account details via
          the Site to other Users. Users are recommended to do so offline, on
          the phone or via personal emails. We follow generally accepted

          procedures are at your sole risk and discretion.

          All disputes involving but not limited to rights conferred,
          compensation, refunds, and other claims through this policy will be
          resolved through a two-step Alternate Dispute Resolution mechanism.
          <br />
          <b>Stage 1: Mediation.</b> In case of a dispute, the matter will first
          be attempted to be resolved by a sole mediator who is a neutral third
          party and will be selected at the mutual acceptance of a proposed
          mediator by both parties. Both parties may raise a name for sole
          arbitrator and in case both parties accept the proposed name, the said
          person shall be appointed as sole mediator. In any case the parties
          are not able to reach a consensus within two proposed mediators, the
          Firm reserves the right to decide who the final mediator is. The
          decision of the mediator is not binding on both parties, however the
          parties in good faith will attempt to bind by the decision.
          <br />
          <b>Stage 2: Arbitration.</b> In case that mediation does not yield a
          result suitable or preferred by any one of the parties, arbitration
          may follow, the award of which is binding on both parties. The
          Arbitration Board shall comprise three members – one appointed by each
          party and the third member to be nominated by the two appointed
          members by mutual consent. Arbitration shall be held at Kolkata, West
          Bengal, India. The proceedings of arbitration shall be in the Bengali
          language. The arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding on the
          Parties. If the dispute cannot be resolved by this two-step Alternate
          Disp1ute Resolution mechanism, it shall be referred to the courts at
          Kolkata, West Bengal, India.
